☐ Revisit how many times we get things from the DB, think of some ways to speed up the process @low @est(2 hours)
☐ Think of a way to get all themes stored locally
  // This may increase the speed that we get 2 random options, as at the moment
  // we need to make a request to the DB, get the theme, then make 2 more requests
☐ Add some more options in
☐ Think about ways we can display percentages on options
  // At the moment we have "timesShown" and "timesPicked", we could possibly do something like
  // Shown 10 times, picked 5, 50%. The problem is that the number won't match for the options
  // Two options shown, 1 may have been shown 50 times before, the other may be shown once before.
  // So the percentages could end up being like 50% and 100%.
☐ Fix the 'Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.' error when adding a new item
